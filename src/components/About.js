                        Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Jane Park, I am 21 years old and I discovered my passion for creative media during my junior year of high school. Since then, I have pursued photography and cinematography as an ongoing hobby and personal journey. Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy exploring my work as much as I have enjoyed creating it.
